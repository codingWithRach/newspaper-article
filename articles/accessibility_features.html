      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Tim Berners Lee dreamt of a World Wide Web that would be free and
        accessible to everyone. Sadly, the modern web is littered with poorly
        designed websites and difficult to navigate code (for both developers
        and users). This often comes down to a lack of understanding around
        different user needs.

        difficult. The developers at Tech Returners News have collated an ‘easy
        wins' checklist for Web page accessibility.
